Socket App
This is a Socket.IO application with a React frontend (using Next.js) and a Node.js backend for real-time communication.

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd socket-app
2. Install dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend, run the following in the root directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the development server
To run both the frontend and backend concurrently, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start both the Next.js frontend and the Socket.IO server.

Frontend (Next.js) will run on http://localhost:3000.
Backend (Socket.IO server) will run on http://localhost:4000 (or whichever port is specified in your backend server).
4. Start Editing
Open the frontend at http://localhost:3000 to see the result.

You can start editing the frontend by modifying the client/pages/index.tsx file. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

5. API Routes
If you need to create API routes, you can add them inside the client/pages/api folder. These will be accessible under the /api/* path.

For example, http://localhost:3000/api/hello can be used to test the backend, and this endpoint can be edited in client/pages/api/hello.ts.

6. Socket.IO Communication
The frontend uses socket.io-client to connect to the backend socket.io server for real-time communication. Ensure the backend is running on the specified port (default is port 4000) for the connection to be established.

7. Deployment
To deploy the application to Vercel, follow these steps:

Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Sign up or log in to Vercel.
Import the project and deploy it with a single click.
For more details, check the Next.js Deployment Documentation.

Notes
Make sure you have Node.js installed to run both frontend and backend.
Ensure that socket.io and socket.io-client are installed in their respective directories (server/package.json for the backend and client/package.json for the frontend).
